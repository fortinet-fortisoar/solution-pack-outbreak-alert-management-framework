# Usage

In this section, we detail the various user flows to understand the scenarios where this solution packâ€™s automation may address your needs.

## Outbreak Response Framework Flowchart 
 
The following is an ideal flow to use the **Outbreak Response Framework** solution pack:

1. Install **Outbreak Response Framework** solution pack.

2. Complete the *Outbreak Response Framework*'s **Configuration Wizard**. The [Setup](./setup.md#setup-outbreak-response-framework-on-fortisoar) section details the configuration process.

3. Install individual *Outbreak Response* solution packs.
    
>[!Note]
>The [**EXAMPLE: Outbreak Response - Progress MOVEit Transfer SQL Injection Vulnerability**](#example-outbreak-response---progress-moveit-transfer-sql-injection-vulnerability) section explains the **Outbreak Response Framework** solution pack's response to *Progress MOVEit Transfer SQL Injection Vulnerability* by way of an example.

4. **Fetch CVEs for KEVs**: Using [NIST](https://docs.fortinet.com/fortisoar/connectors/nist-nvd) integration FortiSOAR checks if an associated CVE is tagged as a KEV. Once found, it creates CVE records in the vulnerability module and links those records to outbreak alerts. Following image shows a CVE record and the information it contains for enhanced threat context:

    ![Information contained in a CVE Record](./res/cve-threat-context-information.png)

> [!Note]
> Due to API issues from NIST, the CVEs and their subsequent information may not update immediately. Refer to the section [Retrieving CVE Information from NIST](#retrieving-cve-information-from-nist) for updating CVEs.

5. **Ingest IOCs as Threat Feeds**: IOCs associated with the Outbreak are ingested as threat feeds in FortiSOAR using Fortinet FortiGuard Outbreak connector.

    Users are notified and the alert severity is raised if an alert containing these IOCs is found in FortiSOAR.

6. **IOC Threat Hunt**: You can perform IOC Threat Hunt, and create IOC hunt incidents of type *Outbreak* in FortiSOAR, using any of the following:

    - Fortinet Fabric solutions (FortiSIEM/FortiAnalyzer)

    - Other SIEM solutions (QRadar/Splunk)

7. **Sigma Rules**: You can perform signature Based Threat Hunt using Sigma Rules:

    1. Perform Signature-based Threat Hunting using Fortinet Fabric solutions (FortiSIEM/FortiAnalyzer) and create incidents of type *Outbreak* in FortiSOAR.

        ![FortiSIEM Fabric Rule](./res/fsm_fortinet_fabric.png)

        ![FortiAnalyzer Fabric Rule](./res/faz_fortinet_fabric.png)

    2. Perform Signature-based Threat Hunting using other SIEM solutions (QRadar/Splunk) and create incidents of type *Outbreak* in FortiSOAR.

        ![Signature Based Threat Hunting Rules](./res/sigma_rule.png)

        Once investigation completes, an incident is created using the targeted IoCs found.

        ![Incident created in FortiSOAR](./res/created_incident_fsr.png)

8. **Mitigation**: Every Outbreak Alert has associated mitigation. FortiSOAR provides the mitigation recommendations using public sources, like patch available, etc.

    ![Mitigation](./res/mitigation.png)

> [!Note]
> The process of updating critical information, for Outbreak Alerts with the statuses *New* or *Tracking*, is now automated. The playbook **Update Outbreak Alert Details** updates key details such as CVEs, background information, and descriptions and is scheduled to run daily. You can review the schedule `Outbreak_Alert_Fetch_Latest_Details` to modify the run frequency.

## Example: Outbreak Response - Progress MOVEit Transfer SQL Injection Vulnerability

Before performing the steps outlined in this section, we recommend setting the global variable `Demo_mode` to `true`. Once done, the following steps generate example data for a better understanding of this solution packs functionality.

1. Install **Outbreak Response Framework** Solution Pack.

2. Complete the *Outbreak Response Framework*'s **Configuration Wizard**.

3. Install **Outbreak Response - Progress MOVEit Transfer SQL Injection Vulnerability**.

4. Navigate to the **Outbreak Management** menu and select **Outbreak Alerts** to view the following screen:

    ![](./res/outbreak-alerts-moveit.png)

6. Click to open the alert and view the following screen that contains description and background information:

    ![](./res/outbreak-alerts-moveit-details.png)

7. Click the **Execute** button and select **Investigate Outbreak** to begin investigation. Since the global variable `Demo_mode` is set to `true`, you are given example data to view and understand the information retrieved from investigation.

    Alternatively, you can click **Investigate Outbreak** button on an Outbreak Alert's detailed view page to get the following wizard:

    ![](./res/pb-as-button.gif)

8. Scroll the alert details page to view CVE IDs, correlations, and alerts, apart from other information:

    ![](./res/outbreak-alerts-moveit-more-details.png)

    More information becomes available as the **Outbreak Response** solution pack creates the following:

    1. **Outbreak Alerts**: An outbreak alert contains the following:

        - Outbreak Alert details

        - Mitigation Details

    2. **Threat Hunt Rules**: The following rules are imported with outbreak-specific response solution pack:

        - **Yara Rules**: YARA Rules help malware researchers identify and classify malware samples that focus on scanning and identifying malicious files.

        ![Yara Rules](./res/yara_rule.png)

        - **Sigma Rules**: Sigma Rules provide a standard format for log events. They are helpful in searching or pattern matching through log data.
        
        Using Sigma Rules we can create signature-based Threat Hunt Rules for various Threat Detection Integrations like SIEM, Analyzer, or EDR.
        
        - **Fortinet Fabric Rules**: With every Outbreak Alert FortiGuard provides FortiAnalyzer and FortiSIEM as part of Fortinet fabric solution.

9. Select the **Dashboard** tab, under *Outbreak Management*, to view following information:

    ![Outbreak Dashboard](./res/dashboard-outbreak-response-overview.png)

## Retrieving CVE Information from NIST

The CVE information from NIST is fetched as per a schedule - `Outbreak_Ingest-Tracking-Outbreak-CVEs-and-IOCs`. The schedule triggers the playbook **Tracking Outbreak: Retrieve CVEs and IOCs**. The schedule runs daily to retrieve and update this information later.

This playbook references the playbook **Get Outbreak CVEs and IOCs Details** to retrieve and update the relevant CVEs.

You can manually run this playbook to fetch and update the CVE information.

1. Select outbreak alerts from Outbreak Alerts page.
2. Click **Execute** > **Get Outbreak CVEs and IOCs Details**.

> [!Note]
> It is possible that the information is not updated if the NIST API is facing issues. Check the playbook logs for more information.
